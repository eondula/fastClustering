As pointed out by Hiroku (Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems), emergence is observed as systems scale while self-organization over time.
Complex systems are hard to engineer. This project attempts to simplify the nuanced
complexities as observed from a prototype software model that can be used to initiate the learning
component of a neural network architecture.

This project will assume a distributed model as follows:
