abstract = {Clustering in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) is one of the promising technologies in intelligent Transportation System (ITS) fields. Clustering deals with dynamic topologies. It aims to overcome network failure. Vehicular nodes are characterized by high mobility, and as a result dynamic velocity and location changes. To stabilize cluster structure and to make the network connected in a restricted delay are difficult tasks to achieve. In this context, we propose a Fast Clustering scheme to form stable clusters for delay-constrained applications. Our scheme aims to minimize the cluster head election and the cluster member selection latencies. To accelerate the cluster formation process, our algorithm divides the network by taking as parameters the transmission range and the road density. Then, a suitability function determines the eligibility of a node to become a cluster head by considering direction, relative speed, relative distance and other mobility patterns. Our proposal includes also a transition mechanism in order to increase the cluster lifetime in high-speed scenarios and to avoid frequent re-clustering process. Our proposed scheme is compared to an existing Multiagent Driven Dynamic Clustering algorithm.},
